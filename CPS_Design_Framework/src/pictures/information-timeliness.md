# Faded Elements for Stale Data

This sketch shows how fading visual elements can communicate **data staleness** at a glance, without relying on alarms or timestamps.

As time since the last update increases, the element fades to indicate increasing uncertainty.

> This supports Situation Awareness Principle of *Timeliness*

## Example Concept
- Compressor widget fades to 20% opacity after 5 minutes
- A fresh update restores full visibility
- No blinking. Just visual clarity.
